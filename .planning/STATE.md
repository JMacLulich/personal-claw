## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Discord as sole interface: Jason already uses Discord daily; supports text + voice naturally
- Two-step approval (send → confirm): Prevents accidental sends; gives Jason time to reconsider
- Batched delivery by default: Reduces notification anxiety; prevents "oh god what now" feeling
- Voice = text (same safety rules): Prevents voice from bypassing safety gates

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
